# Leicester-Dataset
This dataset is from the University of Leicester, which is about pedestrain on a rainy day.

Usually, the dataset is shot in a brightly lit room or on a sunny day. 

We hope this data set will enrich our data types.

This dataset include 2060 images. This images are taken on a rainy day in winter.

Some pedestrians in the image are wearing hats and some are using umbrellas.

Some people stand still, some run fast.

Water reflection on the ground will affect image recognition. In addition, the branches of trees in winter can obstruct the shooting.
